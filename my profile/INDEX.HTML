<p>
I am in my first year in business school, IESEG, School of Management. As of now, I don't know for sure what I would like to work in as of later. But, the field that interests me the most is finance.

   <h2>Cooking</h2>
     <p>
I love to show my love to others and what better way than to do it by cooking. The expansion of recipes, with the many different flavors I can use too make sure that everyone has a really good and enjoyable dinner.

   <h2>Drawing</h2>
     <p>
It's a way to develop my creativity and to calm myself when I'm stressed. Drawing didn't start as a passion at first, it was mostly something used by my teachers too make us tell how we felt and what emotions we felt.

<h2>Music</h2>
     <p>
I've been practicing it since I was little and it was a way for me to express myself when words wouldn't come out. I played the piano for more than 10 years, even though I don't play anymore, I want to work to get back into it.
